# SL-Sweet

This is a personal side-project with focuses on practicing UIKit, MVVM in UIKit, fetching APIs, animations, and Autolayout as I previously mainly worked with MVVM SwiftUI [(my project)](https://github.com/jjtsai0907/Xkcd-Comics).

# Basic Info

At the moment, there ar five main features in the app.
- Traffic Status:
  - API: SL Trafikläget 2
- Text Recognizer & Text Speech
  - The idea behind is to provide a solution for people who cannot read well from traffic bulletboards or digital screens due to distance or text sizes.
  - One can either take a photo or choose an image from its device to recognize and read the texts. 
- Realtime Info
  - API: SL Realtidsinformation 4
- Small Game
  - Bored while waiting for a bus? This game makes it more fun!

**_Please also note that this is a learning-by-doing app. Currenctly, there are several unfinished features and unpolished code, especially with its UI Design & MVVM Design Pattern._**


# Future Development/ Features
I have some other ideas that I would like to bring with in this project.

- A note on (lock or home) screen: when one decided which train/ bus to take, the travel info is saved and displays on lock or home screen. 
  This makes it easier for people to check its travel plan. (possible solution: Widget/ Notification)

- Fun with friends: able to connect with friends in the app and display which time and route one takes just for fun. Maybe also collect points? (possible solution: Firebase)

- Women/ kids travel alone late: to find other women or chrildren to travel together in late evenings. Use BankID to verify identity and security? GPS?
